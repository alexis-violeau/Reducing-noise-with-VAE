Example of use case of VAE to denoise data

The experiment set up use sinusoides with random phases and white noise that are generated in the notebook.

The goal is to show the kind of latent representation that a variational autoencoder can learn, and its efficiency to reconstruct denoised data.

This tool can be used to remove noise and detect outliers within a dataset with strong hypothesis of consistency between the different sample (here, all shape are sinusoidal).
